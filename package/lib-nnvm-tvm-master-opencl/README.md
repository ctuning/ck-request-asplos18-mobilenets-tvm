**Deprecated!**

This package is deprecated as `nnvm` sources was moved to `tvm` repo and it only saved for the sake of history.

This old package is switched to the first commit after nnmv was moved. But program `request-tvm-nnvm-inference` fails with message `Target llvm is not enabled`.

Use package `ck-tvm:package:lib-tvm-master-llvm-opencl` instead.
